# Voronyz

This is the Voronyz Engineering website built with Next.js.

## Project Structure

- `web/` - The main Next.js application
- `netlify.toml` - Netlify deployment configuration

## Quick Start

You can deploy this app to Netlify **without any environment variables** for testing:

1. Push this code to GitHub
2. Connect your repository to Netlify
3. Deploy - it will work out of the box with demo data!

## Deployment

This project is configured for deployment on Netlify. The Next.js app is located in the `web/` folder, and the `netlify.toml` file in the root configures Netlify to build from that directory.
